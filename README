Git Configuration :

I use git both in my company and also in github and google. So my global git configuration file only holds my company profile. To configure a secondary git profile for google, I followed these steps:

Here is how I got an error when I tried to push this README file with my comrany user name and email.

$ git push origin master
fatal: remote error: Invalid username/password.
You may need to use your generated googlecode.com password; see https://code.google.com/hosting/settings


1. I Overrode git user name and email in .git/config file
2. I deleted my user name from remote origin host url

$ cat xml2mib/.git/config
...
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://code.google.com/p/xml2mib/
...
[user]
	name = [your google name]
	email = [your google mail]

2. I checked my git user name & email. 

$ git config user.name
[your google user name goes here]
$ git config user.email
[your google mail goes here]

3. I created ~/.netrc file in my home directory
4. I Followed the steps in https://code.google.com/hosting/settings
